Magento introduced many performance and stability fixes between 1.4 and 1.6 to their Mage_ImportExport module. 
Unfortunately, the current catalog API still uses original Magento models which means product imports may take up to 5 seconds per product. 
This (modman) module is an attempt to provide an API interface to the ImportExport module so that you can do fast XMLRPC/SOAP based imports.
You can simply provide your (array-based) import data in the exact same way as you would provide CSV files to ImportExport.

The following is a very simple benchmark run done with 10,000 simple products on a Virtual Machine running Debian, with 1GB RAM and without any MySQL optimizations. Your experiences may vary.
